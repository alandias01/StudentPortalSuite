    <p>
        The concepts learned in Algebra I prepare students for Algebra II and Geometry.
        Beginning algebra students learn concepts through lessons and practice.
        Online and offline projects allow students to further develop their new skills in practical,
        real-life situations, building an appreciation for how Algebra can be used in life outside of school.
        The study of algebra teaches topics such as finding patterns, balancing equations, and using graphs,
        lines, and arithmetic to understand quantities or dimensions. It also includes the study of ratios,
        percents, and probability. After completing this course, students will be ready to move on to Algebra II
        or Geometry.
